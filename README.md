# migration-master
GitHub Repository for our little migration project, which we did during the course "infrastructure engineering" for the student programme "Cloud Computing Engineering" at the University of Applied Sciences Burgenland (Eisenstadt/Austria).

The code in this repository is not actively maintained, but you can use it as a reference for your own project.

The main goal of the case study was to perform a VM migration from (on-premises) VMware vSphere to Microsoft Azure using Azure Site Recovery Services and the Azure Site Recovery REST API.
